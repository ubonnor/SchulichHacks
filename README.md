This repo contains the files and information from team BMEG Disruptors at the Schulich Hacks Event from April 28-29, 2023 at the University of Calgary. The files are as follows:
* MachineLearningAlgorithm.ipynb
  * This is the algorithm that was created to analyze water samples for microplastics
  * It uses a dataset that was obtained from [this link](https://universe.roboflow.com/panats-mp-project/microplastic-dataset/dataset/19)
* GoogleCloudIotCoreIntegration
  * This is the algorithm that takes input from the user (frequency of data collection) and takes images of the flow using an HD camera
* User Interface-Export-04-29-2023.xml
  * This algorithm is the user interface on a computer
* The CAD of the washing machine in our physical proto was acquired from: https://grabcad.com/library/dcn28-endustriyel-yikama-makinasi-1
  * The PlastiCam was added to the back of the washing machine by our team
